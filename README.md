Fungal alpha-amylase is a pivotal enzyme in the food industry, known for its ability to break down complex starches into simple sugars. This enzyme plays an essential role in various applications, such as:
Baking: Improves dough handling, enhances crust color, and ensures a softer crumb texture.
Brewing: Facilitates the conversion of starches into fermentable sugars, improving efficiency and yield.
Confectionery: Enhances sweetness and reduces viscosity in syrups and fillings.
2. Bacterial Xylanase:
Xylanase is instrumental in breaking down hemicellulose, a major component of plant cell walls. Its applications include:
Bakery Products: Enhances dough stability, volume, and crumb structure.
Brewing: Improves filtration efficiency and clarity in beer production.
Animal Feed: Boosts nutrient availability by breaking down plant-based feed components.
3. Cellulase:
Cellulase is crucial for hydrolyzing cellulose into glucose and other simple sugars. Its versatility extends to:
Juice and Wine Production: Enhances juice yield, clarity, and flavor extraction.
Baking: Improves dough elasticity and volume.
Plant-Based Products: Optimizes texture and quality in plant-based food innovations.
4. Protease:
Protease enzymes specialize in breaking down proteins into peptides and amino acids. They serve multiple purposes, such as:
Dairy Industry: Enhances the production of cheese and whey protein isolates.
Meat Processing: Tenderizes meat for better texture and flavor.
Baking: Reduces gluten strength, improving dough extensibility.
